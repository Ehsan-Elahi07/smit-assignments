# Passing props to dynamic and reusable components

Work through these exercises to try out a few new things with props.

- Write a new component called `MediaCard` that accepts 3 props: title, body, and imageUrl.

- Inside the component, render the title in an `<h2>` tag, the body in a `<p>` tag, and pass the imageUrl into an img tag like `<img src={imageUrl}/>`.

  (Can you return all 3 of these things at once? Or do you need to wrap them in another element?)

- Render the MediaCard with the ReactDOM.render call, and pass in the necessary props.

  (Can you pass a JSX element as a prop value? hint: wrap it in single braces).

- Try **bolding** some parts of the body text **without changing** the implementation of MediaCard.

- Make a component called `Gate` that accepts 1 prop called **“isOpen”**. When isOpen is true, make the component render **“open”**, and when isOpen is false, make it render **“closed”**.

  (Hint: you can do conditional logic inside JSX with the ternary (question mark, ?) operator, inside single braces, like this: `{speed > 80 ? "danger!" : "probably fine"}` (which evaluates to “danger!” if speed is over 80, and “probably fine” otherwise).)

> Make sure to spend some time practicing the stuff you learn!
