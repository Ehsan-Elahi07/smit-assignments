# Rendering array of objects in React

## Objective

Create a simple React component that takes an array of user objects and displays them in a list format.

- Go to this URL and copy the data : [dummyjson.com/product](https://dummyjson.com/product)

- Paste the data in a new file called `data.js` in your project.
- Import the data in your component and render the data in a list format.
- Product data should be displayed in the following format:
  - Product tile
  - Price
  - Description
  - Image

### Additional

- Create ProductList Component:

  - Create a new component file named ProductList.js.
  - This component should receive the array of products as props and render each product's name, price, and description in a list.

- Render ProductList Component:

  - Use the ProductList component in your main App component.
  - Pass the product data to the ProductList component as props.

### Tips

- **Styling:** You can use CSS to style your product list for better visual appeal.
- **Keys:** Remember to use a unique key prop for each list item to help React identify which items have changed.
- **Component Structure:** Keep your components clean and focused on a single responsibility.
