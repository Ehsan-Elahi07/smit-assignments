# Managing State

Run through these quick exercises to solidify your understanding:

- Make 2 buttons: `“ON”` and `“OFF”`. Turn the light either ON or OFF depending on which button is clicked by wiring up the **onClick handlers** to set the `state`.

- Add another piece of `state`: the room temperature. Initialize it to 22 Celsius. Display the current temperature under the light status.

  - Add 2 more buttons: `“+”` and `“-”`. Then add onClick handlers that will **increase or decrease the temperature by 1 degree** when clicked (Hint: you can call useState more than once!)

> State is one of the trickier concepts to grok in React. Don’t worry if it doesn’t click immediately.
